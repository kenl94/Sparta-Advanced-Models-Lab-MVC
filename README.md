# Sparta-Advanced-Models-Lab-MVC

## Description

Building out our understanding of rails and making a index page for the models we have created.
We have also added bootstrap to the pages and this has led to us being able to style it.

# Challenges

The main challenge I had was selecting the necessary elements on the page and styling it as it is very different when doing so in rais in comparison to normal front end styling.
